The fears have especially elevated after an incident of religious discrimination earlier this year in which the LRO accused the Christian missionaries of using children to foment protest and not allowing a priest belonging to a local faith to be cremated at the traditional ceremony. This case had gone to the High Court which ruled in favour of LRO. Thus the issue is essentially the conflict between missionaries and Hindu Organisation and their respective treatment of the indigenous population.",
